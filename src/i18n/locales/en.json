Antibiotics:\n   - Validamycin 5% (30ml/20 liters water)\n   - Kasugamycin 2% (40ml/20 liters water)\n\n2. Copper fungicides:\n   - Copper Hydroxide 77% WP (20g/20 liters water)\n   - Spray every 7-10 days\n\n3. Agricultural measures:\n   - Remove diseased leaves, destroy away from field\n   - Increase potassium to boost resistance\n   - Avoid flooding rice in the afternoon\n\n📅 Spray schedule: 2-3 times, 7-10 days apart"
